# glove-sign-alphabet
Glove to translate sign language to text . Arduino code.

### Materials and Methods 
1. Arduino Nano Board
2. HC-05 Bluetooth Module (to send outcome value to the Android app)
3. 5 Flex Sensors (to measure the finger movements)
4. Resistor 10k Ohm (to lower the 5V vcc to 3.3V, we need this to send data safely to the HC-05)
5. Wires
6. Glove

### Features

- Created our own sign language gestures.
- The glove connects to a mobile app via Bluetooth.
